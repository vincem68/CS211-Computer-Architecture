This program takes a text file that represents a matrix and does multiplication with it, returning the result in a text file. The text file would have the first line
be an integer that specifies the number of rows and columns of the matrix, the next lines would be the numbers inside the matrix, and the final line would be an 
integer saying how many times the matrix would be multiplied with itself.
