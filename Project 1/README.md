This repository is a collection of small programs that made up my first project of computer architecture. The main goal of this project was simply to learn and get used to C, making use of its unique functions such as malloc and pointers. 

Palindrome: A program that takes in a string and determines whether the string is a palindrome or not.

String Compression: A program that takes in a string containing alphabetic characters with repeating characters consecutive 
characters and compresses it (for example, aaaabbb is a4b3), unless the original string is shorter than the compressed string.

Roman Number: A program that takes a number as a string value and returns it in Roman numeral form.

Linked List: This program takes in a command and an integer and uses them to perform an action on a linked list. The 'i' command
inserts a number (ex: i 5) and the 'd' command deletes a number (ex: d 5), and after each command the program prints the length of the list and the value of the nodes in the list. The numbers are sorted in ascending value. The program runs until the user terminates it. The program either takes commands from the command line or a text file with each command on a separate line.

Binary Tree: The same concept as Linked List, except the numbers are stored in a binary tree. There are two additional commands, the 's' command where the program searches for a given number (ex: s 3) and either prints 'present' or 'absent', 
and 'p' which just prints the current tree structure. The tree also does not allow duplicates. 

Matrix Multiplication: A program that takes a text file, the first line being an integer k declaring the matrix to have k rows 
and columns, the next k lines being the matrix values, and a last line having an integer n telling the program how many times 
to multiply the given matrix by itself. Returns the resulting matrix.
